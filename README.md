# Genealogical Networks in al-ʿAqīqī's Kitāb al-Muʿaqqibīn

Nasab (genealogical) sources are an excellent source for the historian of early Islam interested in reconstructing social and marriage ties.
There are, however, numerous issues associated with trying to visually represent bilateral and polygamous kinship ties, it is the hope of the IMBOD team that we can mitigate these issues via network analysis to visually represent the marriage links of the Imamī family and the wider Ṭālibid elites.
The current dataset relates to the earliest Ṭalibid genealogy, the _Kitāb al-Muʿāqqibīn of al-ʿAqīqī_.

# Purpose of the project
Drawing bilateral family trees representing the Imamī family using `visnetwork` within Rstudio.

We also want to provide a "toolkit" for scholars of early Islam who wish to start learning Digital Humanities techniques but do not have their own datasets by making the collated data freely available as well as providing code examples for what can be done.

## How to use
Download the dataset from github and import into Rstudio
Follow the RScript titled Zayd_Descendants_AKM

``` Bash R
AKM <- read.csv('/path/to/your/file/here/AKM.csv')
```
